## 😄 Fun Facts
I’m all about leading a healthy lifestyle, tackling martial arts, and chasing the thrills of life. A firm believer in the balance between mind and body, I love the discipline and focus that comes from weightlifting and martial arts. Being a dad to three boys, I find joy in the everyday hustle and guess I have a thing for thriving in chaos!
